# codewars_training
I am starting to train my logic on codewars.  Thank you, my Teacher - Artem Rysich, for making me fall in love with coding, and most importantly, for keeping me from burning out)))

Other solutions to the task by other members of the codevars platform.

P.S.but not all, some of them I solved in a different way))
